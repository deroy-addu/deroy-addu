# Hi there
I’m a full-stack web developer focused on building reliable, performant, and maintainable products.  
My main stack revolves around **TypeScript** — on both the client and server.

### What I care about
- Clean code with clear intent
- Strong typing and predictable behavior
- Developer experience and tooling
- Automated testing that actually protects codebases
- Systems that scale without turning into spaghetti

### Currently
Shipping projects, learning continuously, and always looking for ways to reduce complexity while increasing leverage.

<h1 align="center">“Full-stack developer with big ideas, clean code, and zero apps deployed — for now.”</h1>

## Hi there 👋

I’m a full-stack web developer focused on building **reliable, performant, and maintainable** web products.  
My core stack is **TypeScript**, used end-to-end across both the frontend and backend.

I care less about chasing trends and more about writing software that’s easy to understand, evolve, and trust.

## What I care about 🧠

- ✨ Clean, readable code with clear intent
- 🔒 Strong typing and predictable behavior
- 🛠️ Thoughtful developer experience and tooling
- 🧪 Automated tests that genuinely protect the codebase
- 🧱 Systems that scale without turning into spaghetti

## Currently 🚀

Building and shipping projects, learning continuously, and refining my approach to reduce complexity while increasing leverage.
